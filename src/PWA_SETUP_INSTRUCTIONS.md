# 🛴 Scooter Smart Lights - PWA Setup Instructions

Your app is now a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**! Follow these steps to test it on your Android phone.

## 📱 Step 1: Generate App Icons

4. Place both icon files in the `/public` folder

## 🚀 Step 2: Deploy Your App

You need to host your app on HTTPS. Choose one of these options:

### Option A: Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Deploy (takes ~1 minute)

### Option B: Netlify
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag & drop your project folder
4. Get your HTTPS URL

### Option C: GitHub Pages
1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Your URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/project-name`

## 📲 Step 3: Install on Android

1. Open your deployed app URL in **Chrome** on your Android phone
2. You'll see an install banner - tap **"Install"** or **"Add to Home Screen"**
   
   *If you don't see it:*
   - Tap the **⋮** menu (three dots) in Chrome
   - Select **"Add to Home Screen"** or **"Install app"**

3. The app icon will appear on your home screen!

## ✅ PWA Features You Now Have

- **📱 Home Screen Icon** - Launch like a native app
- **🎨 Full Screen** - No browser UI
- **⚡ Fast Loading** - Cached resources
- **📡 Offline Support** - Works without internet (UI only)
- **🔄 Auto Updates** - New versions load automatically
- **📳 Vibration Feedback** - Haptic responses on button clicks
- **🎯 Standalone Mode** - Feels native

## 🧪 Test Locally (Optional)

To test PWA features locally before deploying:

```bash
# Install a local HTTPS server
npx serve -s . -p 3000 --ssl-cert ./localhost.pem --ssl-key ./localhost-key.pem

# Or use http-server with HTTPS
npx http-server -S -C cert.pem -K key.pem
```

Note: PWAs require HTTPS, except on localhost.

## 🔧 What Was Added

### Files Created:
- `/public/manifest.json` - PWA configuration
- `/public/sw.js` - Service worker for offline support
- `/public/index.html` - HTML with PWA meta tags
- `/components/InstallPrompt.tsx` - Install prompt component

### Features:
- ✅ Service worker caching
- ✅ Offline support
- ✅ Install prompt
- ✅ Mobile-optimized viewport
- ✅ Theme color for Android status bar
- ✅ Splash screen support
- ✅ App shortcuts

## 📱 Using Bluetooth on PWA

**Important:** The Web Bluetooth API works in PWA mode! However:
- Requires **Android Chrome/Edge** (iOS Safari doesn't support it)
- Your app must be served over **HTTPS**
- User must grant Bluetooth permissions

## 🎨 Customization

### Change App Colors:
Edit `/public/manifest.json`:
```json
"theme_color": "#030213",  // Android status bar color
"background_color": "#ffffff"  // Splash screen color
```

### Change App Name:
Edit `/public/manifest.json`:
```json
"name": "Your App Name",
"short_name": "Short Name"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Install button doesn't show?**
- Make sure you're on HTTPS
- Check if already installed
- Try Chrome flags: `chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks`

**Service worker not registering?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `/sw.js` is accessible
- Clear browser cache and hard reload

**Bluetooth not working?**
- Only works on Chrome/Edge on Android
- Requires HTTPS
- Check browser permissions

## 📊 Monitor Your PWA

After deploying, use these tools:
- Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse → PWA audit
- Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- [web.dev/measure](https://web.dev/measure) - Test PWA score

## 🎉 You're Done!
